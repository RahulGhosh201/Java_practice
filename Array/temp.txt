Difference between array, arrayList and list
1. array has fixed size
    int[] arr=new int[5];
    String[] str={"Apple", "Banana", "Apple", "Orange"};
    Multidimensional array->int arr[][]=new int[r][c];

2. ArrayList is part of java's collections framework.
    in case of arrayList, you don't need to specify the size upfront.
    we can dynamically resize itself when elements are added or removed.

    ArrayList<Integer> arr=new ArrayList<>();
    arr.add(1);
    arr.add(2);
    
3. List is a collection of ordered elements. Both ArrayList and LinedList are concrete implementations
    of the 'List' interface.
    List<Integer> list=new ArrayList<>();
    list.add("Banana");
    list.add("Apple");


Use an Array if you need a simple, fixed-size collection of elements and performance is critical.
Use an ArrayList when you need a resizable array-like structure and want the convenience of built-in methods.
Use a List when you want to write more flexible and general code, allowing you to switch between different list implementations if necessary.
